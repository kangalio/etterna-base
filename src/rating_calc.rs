/*
The idea is the following: we try out potential skillset rating values
until we've found the lowest rating that still fits (I've called that
property 'okay'-ness in the code).
How do we know whether a potential skillset rating fits? We give each
score a "power level", which is larger when the skillset rating of the
specific score is high. Therefore, the user's best scores get the
highest power levels.
Now, we sum the power levels of each score and check whether that sum
is below a certain limit. If it is still under the limit, the rating
fits (is 'okay'), and we can try a higher rating. If the sum is above
the limit, the rating doesn't fit, and we need to try out a lower
rating.
